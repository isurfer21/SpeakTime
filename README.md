Using the *audio voice message* commands, we can make Windows 10 / 8 / 7 tell us the time every hour. This can be especially useful if you tend to lose track of time while working.

Please follow these steps to make your Windows operating system speak out time every hour just like MacOSX.

1. Get this project **SpeakTime** on your local drive by either of these ways:
	1. Download zip
	2. Pull request
2. Copy the actual path of the `SpeakTime.vbs` file.
3. Modify the *Shortcut* link.
	1. Right click on the `SpeakTime.lnk` file to open context menu.
	2. Click on the *Properties* item to open *SpeakTime Properties*.
	3. In the *SpeakTime Properties*, select the *Shortcut* tab & focus on the *Target* section. 
	4. Replace the actual path of `SpeakTime.vbs` with the copied one. 
	5. Click on *Apply* button followed by *OK* button
4. Schedule it to run every hour.
	1. Open the *Task Scheduler*, you can press `WIN + R`, type in `taskschd.msc`, and hit *Enter* to start.

	2. In *Task Scheduler*, click *Create Task* under *Action*.
	3. Give a name under *General* tab, such as `SpeakTime`.
	4. Add a trigger to run the task repeatedly very hour. Like below:

	5. Add an action under Actions tab, like below: 
		
		![Task Manager Add an action](http://www.nextofwindows.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Task-Manager-Add-an-action.png)

	6. Thatâ€™s it. Click Ok to close out it.
